# ASSESSMENT 5: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What does calling super do in a Ruby class?

Your answer: Calling a super is calling an additional method to go along with another method from a class.

Researched answer: Calling super in a Ruby class will cause the class to be instantiated a number of times, beginning with the most recently instantiated class. This is called a superclass constructor invocation.

2. What is a gem? 

Your answer: A gem is an application that can be installed for Ruby.

Researched answer: A Rubygem is a set of related or dependent libraries or "things" that can be installed for Ruby.


3. What is a relational database? Are there other kinds of databases? 

Your answer: A relational database is a database that uses data for later use.

Researched answer: A relational database — or a "database" in Ruby — is a set of data tables that are linked together by a foreign key relationship. Other databases are NoSQL, object-oriented, hierarchical, and network databases.

4. What are primary keys? Why purpose does a primary key serve?

Your answer: The column names of a table that assign ids.

Researched answer: Primary keys are a feature of database systems that allow one table to have only one row. This means the row is the unique identifier for a row. The table cannot have more than one primary key.

5. What are the five HTTP verbs? What is each verb's corresponding CRUD action?

Your answer: The five HTTP verbs are “GET”, “POST”, “PUT”, “DELETE”, and “PATCH”. Corresponding with CRUD is "CREATE" = "POST", "READ" = "GET", "UPDATE" = "PUT", and "DELETE" = "DELETE".

Researched answer: The CRUD action is the action that allows a client to make a request to update, create, read, or delete a row in a database table. The GET, POST, PATCH, PUT, and DELETE operations are the basic operations on a web service. The POST and DELETE operations create or remove a resource, while the PUT and PATCH operations update existing resources.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Model validations: Model validations let you validate data at a higher level than just a field. Learn how to make sure a field is entered only one time.

2. RESTful routes: RESTful routes let you build a web service using only the HTTP protocol. Use the routes to specify what action should be taken given a specific URL.

3. ERB: Embedded Ruby language. It's a little like HTML but for Ruby.

4. Params: The parameters passed to a method. In Rails, the params are the data coming in from a web browser.

5. API: Programming interface for a programming language.
